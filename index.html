  <h3><TAG>Quotations</TAG></h3>
   <p>
     In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
     Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
   </p>

   <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #c7ede9;">
     <p>
       <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
       <br>
       â€”Abraham Lincoln

<h2>Michel Hartel</h2>

      Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/"> Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

       When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

<h2>Nick Mervin</h2>
    <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
